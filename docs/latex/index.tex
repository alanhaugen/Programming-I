This Compulsory will cover elements such as use of pointers, classes and objects (Object Oriented Programming).\hypertarget{index_desc_sec}{}\doxysection{Description}\label{index_desc_sec}
We want to model the archive system of a computer. This will have two types of elements\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_folder}{Folder}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_file}{File}}, which will have different types of properties. Specifically, they will both have a name, size, and date of creation. On the other hand, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_folder}{Folder}} will also have an array of maximum 10 Files, and an array of maximum 5 Folders. We need operations to create new Files and new Folders, with a random size of maximum 100 MB (just generate a number between 0 and 100 for this). We also want to know the names, sizes, and dates of creation, as well as operations to change the name of the Files and Folders. We finally want to be able to print all the information of a given \mbox{\hyperlink{class_file}{File}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{class_folder}{Folder}} (in the case of Folders, that includes printing all Files within it).\hypertarget{index_Instructions}{}\doxysection{Instructions}\label{index_Instructions}
In the main program, we want to be able to create all of these types of objects, and we also want to look through the Files in a given folder and return the information (name, size, date of creation) of the largest \mbox{\hyperlink{class_file}{File}}. For these, the user needs to specify the name of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_folder}{Folder}} they want to look through for both of these operations. Create in the main one \mbox{\hyperlink{class_folder}{Folder}} that will hold all this information.\hypertarget{index_Submission}{}\doxysection{Submission}\label{index_Submission}
