For this Compulsory, you will have to create a program using a Procedural Programming Paradigm approach to implement a calculator that will perform the following operations\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Factorial (use recursion)
\item Solving 3rd degree polynomial equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
\item Simple math equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_Instructions}{}\doxysection{Instructions}\label{index_Instructions}
In order to do this, create a menu system that will allow the user to choose between these three options, as well as offer a choice to terminate the program. Use functions to keep the code as clear and modular as possible. Control for unexpected inputs (strings where numbers are expected). Use X\+ML documentation practices for all defined functions. The submission will be a P\+DF with Surname\+\_\+\+Name\+\_\+\+Compulsory2 and have the following\+:
