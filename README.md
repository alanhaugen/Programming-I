# Hans Alan Whiburn Haugen

Find my Programming-I repository and session-I branch here: [https://github.com/alanhaugen/Programming-I/tree/Compulsory1](https://github.com/alanhaugen/Programming-I/tree/Compulsory1)

As I prefer using a mac, I have provided the project as a Makefile, QtCreator qbs file (I **HIGHLY** recommend QtCreator) and a CMakeLists.txt file. You can open the CMakeLists.txt file with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition, alternatively you can use it with cmake to create project files for vscode. I hope this is acceptable.

I have done a lot of programming in the past. I have an A in C++ from a University in Scotland. I studied Computer Games Application Development at Abertay University, the first University to provide a games education in the world. I have worked on a lot of hobby projects since. Feel free to look into my previous work via my github and personal website below:

I hope to play around more with C++ and learn the language even better. I like going over the basics and hope to do well in this course. I am personally particularly looking forwards to learning modern openGL later, I know programming quickly becomes rather difficuly so I am happy to be doing easier courses before going onto more difficult tasks.
