# Hans Alan Whiburn Haugen

Find my Programming-I repository and session-I branch here: [https://github.com/alanhaugen/Programming-I/tree/Compulsory1](https://github.com/alanhaugen/Programming-I/tree/Compulsory1)

As I prefer using a mac, I have provided the project as a Makefile, QtCreator `qbs` file (I **HIGHLY** recommend *QtCreator*) and a `CMakeLists.txt` file. You can open the `CMakeLists.txt` file with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition, alternatively you can use it with cmake to create project files for vscode. I hope this is acceptable.

The program I wrote can be found in `main.cpp`

Notice I commented out the C-way of doing standard output.

```cpp
//#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream> // This includes the output library for C++

int main() // This is the main entry point of the program
{
    //printf("Hello, world"); (old C way)

    // This will output a message and an endline
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl; 

    return 0;  // This exits the program with success
}
```

I have done a lot of programming in the past. I have an A in C++ from a University in Scotland. I studied Computer Games Application Development at Abertay University, the first University to provide a games education in the world. I have worked on a lot of hobby projects since. Feel free to look into my previous work via my github and personal website below:

To open the `qbs` file, please check out [QtCreator open source](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)

I hope to play around more with C++ and learn the language even better. I like going over the basics and hope to do well in this course. I am personally particularly looking forwards to learning modern OpenGL later, I know programming quickly becomes rather difficuly so I am happy to be doing easier courses before going onto more difficult tasks.
